## Overview

Many UH Computer Science and Engineering students want to learn about internship and job opportunities, but currently, they must wait until a company reaches out with a visit or announcement. There is no centralized way for students to explore the landscape of opportunities and prepare in advance.

**Campus Careers** solves this by offering a new way for local and non-local companies to share potential opportunities with UH students. It also allows students to showcase their interests and get matched with companies looking for their skill sets.

## Team

- **Mason Lee**
  
- **Phoebe Chang**

- **Jayden Huynh**
  
- **Kristian Soares**

- **Alexander Chang**
 

## Goals

**The goal of Campus Careers is to:**

- Help companies promote internships and job opportunities to UH students in a more consistent, ongoing way.
- Allow students to create professional profiles with interests and skills.
- Match students and companies based on compatibility.
- Provide admins tools to moderate the site and manage skill/location categories.

## Features

- **Company pages with:**
  - Company overview
  - Location
  - List of commonly recruited positions with skills, type (internship/full-time), desired hires, and salary range
  - Contact info and links

- **Student profiles with:**
  - Skills and interests
  - Preferred location
  - Portfolio links

- **Admin features to:**
  - Monitor content
  - Manage skills/geographic categories

- Search and filtering for matching students and companies
