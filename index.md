## Development History

The development process for pineapple-spire conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics414s25/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell:

* Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
* Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
* Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
* Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
* The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue number.
* When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
* The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.

The following sections document the development history of pineapple-spire.
