## Overview

Many UH Computer Science and Engineering students want to learn about internship and job opportunities, but currently, they must wait until a company reaches out with a visit or announcement. There is no centralized way for students to explore the landscape of opportunities and prepare in advance.

**Campus Careers** solves this by offering a new way for local and non-local companies to share potential opportunities with UH students. It also allows students to showcase their interests and get matched with companies looking for their skill sets.

## Goals

The goal of Campus Careers is to:

- Help companies promote internships and job opportunities to UH students in a more consistent, ongoing way.
- Allow students to create professional profiles with interests and skills.
- Match students and companies based on compatibility.
- Provide admins tools to moderate the site and manage skill/location categories.

## Features

- Company pages with:
  - Company overview
  - Location
  - List of commonly recruited positions with skills, type (internship/full-time), desired hires, and salary range
  - Contact info and links

- Student profiles with:
  - Skills and interests
  - Preferred location
  - Portfolio links

- Admin features to:
  - Monitor content
  - Manage skills/geographic categories

- Search and filtering for matching students and companies

## Mockups

Here are some early mockup pages (subject to change as development progresses):

> _Note: All UI/UX mockups are in early development and will continue to evolve during the project._

## Use Cases

- A new user visits the landing page, logs in, and creates a profile.
- An admin logs in to review and manage categories and users.
- A student searches for companies that match their skillset and location preferences and reaches out.

## Advanced Feature Ideas

- Notification system via email or SMS.
- Activity tracking and analytics for companies.
- Enhanced filtering and personalized recommendations.
